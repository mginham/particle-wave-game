# Particle Wave Game
A Java-based simulation game demonstrating the interaction of particles in a wave-like environment. Inspired by tutorials from @RealTutsGML.

## About the Game
In this simulation, particles move through a wave medium, interacting with each other and the environment. The game showcases basic physics principles such as particle motion, collision detection, and wave propagation.

## Features
- Particle Movement: Simulate particles moving in a 2D space.
- Wave Interaction: Particles interact with wave fronts, demonstrating wave-particle duality.
- Collision Detection: Basic collision detection between particles and boundaries.
- User Controls: Interact with the simulation using keyboard inputs.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/mginham/particle-wave-game.git
cd particle-wave-game
```
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Build and run the Game.java file located in the src/codes directory.

## How to Play
- Start the Simulation: Run the Game.java file to start the simulation.
- Controls:
  - Use the arrow keys to move particles.

## Development
### Project Structure
